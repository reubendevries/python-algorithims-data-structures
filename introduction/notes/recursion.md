# Recursion

## What is Recursion?
A way of solving a problem by having a function call itself. A real life metaphor of recursion might look like a nested Russian Doll, where you get one Russian doll, but when you open up the Russian doll you find a smaller one embedded inside it, you can keep on finding a new smaller Russian doll, until the smallest one is unable to be opened. When you reach the smallest doll, you can reverse the process, closing each doll one by one in reverse order.

- Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs
- In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller
- We need to define a base condition so we know when we need to stop the recursion process. Otherwise we will create an infinite loop.
